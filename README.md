# Hello World!

I am Snehashish Laskar. I am fifteen and I am in class 11.
I have been learning and programming with python and other languages for about three years now.
When I started out I had no idea about Programming but now I seem to have gained a lot of knowledge.
I have been working on many Personal Projects but I would 
also like to work on real life projects and implement my programming skills into something useful and helpful. 
I am hopeful that one day I can perhaphs bring some change or do better to do this world by contribuiting my programming skills that I have picked up over the past two years.
